# Chapter 3: Learn to Pay Yourself First

## The Big Revelation: Forget the Budget

### Why Budgets Don't Work
❌ **They're not fun**  
❌ **They go against human nature**  
❌ **They require constant deprivation**  
❌ **They rely on willpower (which fails)**  
❌ **They create financial "diets" that lead to spending binges**

### The Budget Trap
- You track every penny
- You deprive yourself
- You eventually break down
- You go on a shopping binge
- The cycle repeats

**The Problem:** Any system designed to control your impulses will ultimately fail.

**The Solution:** Don't let money control you—YOU control it.

## The Six Routes to Wealth in America

1. **Win it** (Lottery) - Americans spend $70 billion/year on lottery tickets 🎰
2. **Marry it** - You'll pay for it the rest of your life 💍
3. **Inherit it** - Only works if parents are rich (and kind of morbid) 🏦
4. **Sue for it** - Not a reliable system 👨‍⚖️
5. **Budget for it** - Scrimp for 30 years, put off living (Yuck!) 📊
6. **Pay Yourself First** - The ONLY proven, easy way ✅

## The Pay Yourself First Revolution

### What It Means
**When you earn a dollar, the FIRST person you pay is YOU.**

### What Most People Do (Wrong)
1. Earn $1.00
2. Government takes ~$0.30-0.40 (taxes)
3. Pay landlord, credit cards, bills
4. Hope something is "left over"
5. Nothing is left over

### The Problem with This System
- If you earn $50,000/year
- Government takes 30% first
- You actually only have $35,000 to work with
- No wonder people think they need budgets!

---

## Learning from the Government

### The Government Figured It Out First
**1943:** Government realized people couldn't budget for taxes

**Their Solution:**
- Get paid FIRST (before you see your paycheck)
- Make it AUTOMATIC (withholding)
- Create a foolproof system

**Lesson:** They understood human nature and worked WITH it, not against it.

### Your Turn
**Do the same thing the government did:**
- Set up a system where YOU get paid first
- Make it AUTOMATIC
- Create a foolproof plan that works regardless of willpower

## The Critical Questions

### Do You Really Know "Pay Yourself First"?
- [ ] Do you know HOW MUCH to pay yourself first?
- [ ] Do you know WHERE to put the money?
- [ ] Are you ACTUALLY doing it?
- [ ] Is your plan AUTOMATIC?

**Reality Check:** If you can't answer YES to all four, you don't have a real plan to get rich.

## How Much Should You Pay Yourself First?

### The One Hour Per Day Rule

**Key Insight:** Think in HOURS, not just percentages.

#### The Math:
- **$50,000/year** = $1,000/week = **$25/hour**
- **Goal:** Save 12.5% of gross income
- **12.5% of $1,000** = $125/week = **$25/day**
- **$25/day ÷ $25/hour** = **1 hour per day**

### Translation:
**You should work at least ONE HOUR PER DAY for yourself.**

### Reality Check:
- Average American saves less than 5% (22 minutes/day for themselves)
- 1 in 5 workers saves nothing (0 minutes/day)

**Question:** Why would you work 8 hours for others but 0 hours for yourself?

## The Pay Yourself First Formula

### Your Financial Future Based on Savings Rate

| Status | Percentage | What It Means |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Dead Broke** | Less than 0% | Spend more than you earn, carry debt |
| **Poor** | 0% | Save nothing, keep saying "someday..." |
| **Middle Class** | 5-10% | Basic financial security |
| **Upper Middle Class** | 10-15% | Strong financial position |
| **Rich** | 15-20% | Substantial wealth building |
| **Early Retirement** | 20%+ | Financial independence path |

## The Real Cost of NOT Paying Yourself First

### Example: $50,000/Year Salary

**Daily Savings Needed:**
- 10% of income = $200 every 2 weeks
- Equals $14/day

**The Investment:**
- Save $200 every 2 weeks
- Invest for 35 years
- Earn 10% annual return

**The Result:**
### **$1,678,293.78**

**That's what it COSTS you if you DON'T Pay Yourself First.**

---

## Why It Won't Hurt (The Secret)

### The Pretax Advantage
When you use a **pretax retirement account:**

**Saving $14/day actually reduces spendable income by only ~$10/day**

**Why?** Because the money comes out BEFORE taxes, so:
- You save $14
- But your take-home only drops by $10
- The government "subsidizes" your savings through tax savings

## The Automatic Millionaire Promise

### Make This Commitment NOW:

> I, _____________ [YOUR NAME], hereby promise myself that starting this week I will work at least **one hour a day for myself** because I deserve it.
>
> Therefore, I promise that I will start Paying Myself First **_____% of my gross income** no later than **_____ [DATE]**.
>
> Signed: _________________

### Why Write It Down?
**People who write their goals accomplish significantly more than those who don't.**

Minimum benchmark for building wealth

## Key Principles

### The Flow of Money Matters
**Old Way:** Earn → Pay Government → Pay Bills → Try to Save Leftovers → Fail

**New Way:** Earn → Pay Yourself First (Pretax) → Pay Government → Pay Bills → Live on Rest

### Pretax Retirement Accounts
- 401(k) plans
- 403(b) plans
- Traditional IRAs
- SEP IRAs
- And others (covered in detail later)

**Benefit:** You LEGALLY avoid paying taxes on money saved for retirement.

---

## Common Objections (And Why They're Wrong)

### "I can't afford to save 10%"
- Actually, with pretax savings, you can
- It costs less than you think due to tax savings
- You can't afford NOT to save

### "I need a better investment strategy first"
- No. Pay Yourself First is THE foundation
- Without this, nothing else matters
- Stock tips, real estate tricks, etc. are worthless if you don't save first

### "I need to pay off debt first"
- You need to do BOTH (more on this later)
- Saving 10% while paying debt is crucial
- Don't put off your future waiting for perfection

---

## Why This Really Works

### It's Based on Human Nature
- Removes willpower from the equation
- Works with how people actually behave
- Automatic = No decisions = No failures

### It's a System, Not a Goal
- Goals fail when motivation fades
- Systems run automatically forever
- Set it once, benefit for life

### It Prioritizes YOU
- You work for yourself FIRST
- Everyone else gets paid second
- Your future is the priority

---

## The Bottom Line

### The Math is Simple:
**10% of gross income, invested automatically = Eventual millionaire status**

### The Psychology is Powerful:
**Working one hour per day for yourself = Respecting your future self**

### The Method is Foolproof:
**Automation = Success regardless of willpower**

---

## What's Next?

### Two Critical Questions Remain:
1. **HOW** will you Pay Yourself First? (mechanics, accounts, automation)
2. **WHERE** will you put the money? (specific account types, investment options)

**These questions are answered in the next chapter.**

## Chapter Summary

> **The secret to wealth isn't budgeting, discipline, or deprivation. It's setting up an AUTOMATIC system where you Pay Yourself First—before the government, before your bills, before anything else.**

### The Revolution:
