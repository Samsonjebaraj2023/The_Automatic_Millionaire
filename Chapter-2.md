# Chapter 2: The Latte Factor

## Core Message
**Financial freedom is NOT about how much you earn—it's about how much you spend and save.**

## The Income Myth

### Why Higher Income Doesn't Equal Wealth
- Most people believe more money = financial freedom ❌
- Reality: As income rises, spending rises too (lifestyle inflation)
- Income increases get absorbed by upgraded lifestyles
- Result: Savings remain stagnant regardless of salary

### The Truth About Wealth Building
✓ Wealth comes from **controlling spending**  
✓ Don't chase bigger paychecks—manage what you have  
✓ Small changes compound into massive results
