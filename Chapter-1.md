# The Automatic Millionaire: Key Lessons from Jim and Sue's Story

## Core Principles

### 1. Pay Yourself First Automatically
- Save **before** paying bills, not after
- Set up automatic transfers from every paycheck directly into savings
- Ensures consistent saving regardless of income or spending habits
- Removes the temptation to spend what you intended to save

### 2. Automate Everything
**The Secret: Automation > Willpower**
- Automate savings contributions
- Automate investment deposits
- Automate mortgage payments (including extra payments)
- Automate charitable giving
- Once set up, no thinking required—the system works for you

### 3. Live Below Your Means
The McIntyres' approach:
- Never carried credit card debt
- Paid off mortgages quickly
- Bought used vehicles
- Avoided lifestyle inflation
- Chose **ownership and freedom** over appearances

### 4. The "Latte Factor"
- Small, habitual expenses add up dramatically over time
- Examples: daily coffee, cigarettes, impulse purchases
- Redirect these small amounts toward wealth-building
- Even $5/day invested can grow to significant wealth over decades

### 5. Invest Early, Regularly, and Automatically
- Prioritize retirement account contributions
- Buy a home and make extra mortgage payments
- Consider rental properties for additional income
- Let compound interest work over time
- Consistency matters more than large amounts

## What Makes This Unique?
